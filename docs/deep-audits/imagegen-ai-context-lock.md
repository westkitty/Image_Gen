# Image_Gen AI Context Lock

Date: 2026-06-22

This file is the durable operating boundary for future Codex passes in this repo.
It exists to stop the same release facts from drifting.

## Canonical repo facts

- Workspace root: `/Users/andrew/Image_Gen`
- Canonical model home: `/Volumes/wc2tb/ImageGen`
- Runtime bridge: `operator-console/server.js`
- Clean source packager: `scripts/package-source.sh`

## Hard boundaries

- Do not add new model features unless the request explicitly asks for them.
- Do not introduce Flux or SDXL Turbo support by implication.
- Do not move model files, download models, or rewrite external-drive layout.
- Do not commit runtime outputs, caches, screenshots, package archives, or server logs.
- Do not touch `node_modules/`, `runs/`, `state/`, `logs/`, `Potential UI/`, `__MACOSX/`, or
  generated proof blobs.
- Keep Express bound to localhost only.

## Current truth to preserve

- The only supported SDXL exception is the bounded proof-only smoke path.
- `POST /api/actions/sdxl-smoke` is proof-only and does not mean full A1111 parity.
- `scripts/package-source.sh` packages `git archive HEAD` and refuses dirty trees by default.
- `sdcpp-workflow/bin/sdcpp-model-stage-check.sh` must preserve the SDXL smoke proof cache.

## Preferred verification order

1. Read the current docs and the Bible entry that matches the requested boundary.
2. Verify the live tree before claiming anything is complete.
3. Run the narrowest useful sanity checks first.
4. Package only after the tree is clean and the release claim is defensible.

## What this file is not

- It is not a product roadmap.
- It is not a feature wish list.
- It is not a place to restate stale release claims.
